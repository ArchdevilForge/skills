# Model Router

**Core rule:** Prefer NONE or one primary skill. Route by mechanism fit, not habit. Combine only when roles are distinct and necessary.

## When to Use

- The right thinking skill is unclear and you would otherwise guess or stack tools.
- Several catalog skills seem plausible and you need a single primary (or explicit NONE).
- High-stakes work where a wrong frame is costly and a quick domain×type match helps.

## When NOT to Use

- The match is already known or obvious — invoke that skill directly; do not route for show.
- The task is routine implementation with no analytical unknown — reason directly (NONE).
- You are mid-execution of an agreed plan and only need the next concrete step.

## Procedure

1. **Short-circuit.** One skill clearly fits by mechanism → return it alone. No skill clearly improves the work → **NONE**, reason directly. Stop.
2. **Match.** Otherwise scan the cheat-map above; pick the row whose signal matches the problem type (diagnose / decide / understand / create / evaluate / predict / optimize).
3. **Sanity-check.** If the match is forced or the fit is only nominal, return **NONE**. Do not force a frame; re-route at most once.
4. **Multi-skill only as exception.** Add a second skill only when it answers a distinct question the primary leaves open. Cap at two. Near-neighbors and synonyms do not stack.

## Output

```text
outcome: NONE | one | multi
route: <skill slug or NONE>
why: <mechanism fit in one sentence>
```

## Verification

- **Falsify / stop:** If the route is habit or familiarity rather than mechanism fit, discard and return NONE. If multi-skill entries lack distinct roles, collapse to the single best primary.
- **Over-application guard:** Do not route when the skill is already obvious. Do not return more than two skills. Do not cite frameworks not listed above. Do not treat the router as a prerequisite for the 7 leaf skills invoked directly.
